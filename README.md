## 📜 What is LCode?
LCode is a **universal, open-source standard** that assigns short, easy-to-share **alphanumeric codes** to every plot, building, or location in the world.  

Instead of long GPS coordinates or confusing addresses, **one simple code** points to an exact location — forever.

✅ **Open-source** (MIT licensed for code, CC BY 4.0 for docs)  
✅ **Privacy-first** (no need to share your address or coordinates)  
✅ **Global vision** (works for every country, scalable for 100+ years)

---

## 🏗 How It Works
LCode uses a **standardized format**:
CCC-SSS-XXX-YYYYY
- **CCC** → Country Code (numeric, like `001` for USA)  
- **SSS** → State or Province  
- **XXX** → Local Area Code (city or region)  
- **YYYYY** → Unique property/plot identifier  

**Example:**  
001-018-323-X5A2J
➡️ USA → California → Los Angeles → exact plot.
