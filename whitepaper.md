## 1. Abstract

LCode is a compact, alphanumeric, fixed-length code system designed to identify any plot, structure, or point on Earth with precision and ease. A global, language-neutral, and map-independent addressing standard — open sourced for universal adoption.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- Many places lack reliable physical addresses.
- Delivery and emergency services face challenges locating precise spots.
- Temporary zones like events or camps lack standard coordinates.
- Latitude/Longitude is hard to communicate.
- Existing systems are often proprietary or limited regionally.

---

## 3. Solution: LCode System

**Format:**
```
CCC-SSS-XXX-YYYYY
```

- `CCC` (001–999): Country code  
- `SSS` (001–999): State/province  
- `XXX` (000–999): Local area code (e.g. smartphone region)  
- `YYYYY`: 5-character alphanumeric identifier

**Example:** `001-018-323-X5A2J` (US → California → Los Angeles → specific location)

---

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Code Integrity  
Fixed length, case-insensitive, and YYYYY has ≥ 2 letters & 2 digits.

### 4.2 Temporary Codes  
Reserved `XXX` blocks (e.g., 998–999) for short-lived locations. Reusable after a cooling period.

### 4.3 Emergency / Special Codes  
Prefixes in `YYYYY` (EM…, HP…, DR…) to flag shelter, hospital, drone pad, etc.

### 4.4 Verification  
Supports optional checksum or lookup via public registry.

## 5. Use Cases  
- Urban addressing  
- E-commerce / food deliveries  
- Emergency response  
- Events & festivals  
- Rural/farm tagging  
- Drone docking zones  
- Construction/logistics sites

---

## 6. Principles

- **Open Source**: MIT + CC BY  
- **Human-friendly**: Easy to speak and share  
- **Global**: Language and country neutral  
- **Verifiable**: Checksum + registry  
- **Offline-capable**: Can be communicated without data

## 7. Licensing  
- **Specification/content**: CC BY 4.0  
- **Software**: MIT  
- Branding: Attribution required for non-commercial use

---

## 8. Roadmap  
- Country/state rollout  
- Developer SDKs & browser tools  
- Offline integration with GPS  
- Mobile app with scanning and validation  
- Pitch to Google Maps, Amazon, UN, OpenStreetMap  
- Blockchain-backed code issuance
